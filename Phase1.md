       - Allow customers to filter products by categories like coffee, tea, etc.
       - Implement a search bar to help customers find products directly by name or category.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Frontend**: Use React to manage dynamic content and filter functionality.

### **MongoDB Database Schema for Phase 1**

1. **Products Collection**
   - Schema example for the `products` collection:

     ```javascript
     {
       _id: ObjectId,
       name: String,
       description: String,
       category: String, // e.g., coffee, tea, etc.
       price: Number,
       imageUrl: String, // Cloudinary image URL for product images
       createdAt: Date,
       updatedAt: Date
     }
     ```

2. **Contact Messages Collection** (optional if storing messages)
   - Schema for saving customer inquiries (in addition to email notifications):

     ```javascript
     {
       _id: ObjectId,
       name: String,
       email: String,
       message: String,
       createdAt: Date
     }
     ```

2. **Implement Product Catalog Functionality**:
   - **Backend**:
     - Create API endpoints:
       - `GET /api/products`: Retrieve all products for the catalog.
       - `GET /api/products/:id`: Retrieve details for a single product.
     - Fetch data from MongoDB using Mongoose models.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Design React components for product listing and details.
     - Use Axios or Fetch API to retrieve products from the backend and display them in the frontend.

3. **Create About and Contact Pages**:
   - **Contact Page**:
     - Add form validation in React for required fields.
     - Backend:
       - Set up an API endpoint to handle form submissions and integrate with SendGrid for sending email notifications to the shop owner.

4. **Configure Mobile-Friendly Design and SEO**:
