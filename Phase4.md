### **Tasks and Features**

1. **Product Recommendations**
   - **Goal**: Display product recommendations based on users’ browsing and purchase behavior.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Recommendation Algorithm**:
       - Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to suggest similar products.
       - Consider showing “Frequently Bought Together” or “Related Products.”
     - **Recommendations Display**:
       - Display on product pages and the homepage for returning users.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Backend**: Use TensorFlow.js or a simple collaborative filtering algorithm in Node.js.
     - **Data Requirements**: Collect browsing data, user preferences, and purchase history.

2. **Chatbot for Customer Support**
   - **Goal**: Offer a chatbot to handle FAQs and help customers with common inquiries.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Chatbot Training**:
       - Train a chatbot with answers to frequent questions (e.g., product info, shipping policies).
       - Enable it to handle product search and recommendations.
     - **Integration with Website**:
       - Chat interface accessible from all pages for instant assistance.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Tool**: Use Dialogflow or Rasa for NLP-powered chatbots.
     - **Frontend**: Embed a chat widget that interacts with the chatbot API.

3. **Predictive Inventory Management**
   - **Goal**: Help the shop owner manage stock by predicting which products will need restocking.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Predictive Model**:
       - Analyze past sales and seasonality trends to forecast inventory needs.
     - **Inventory Dashboard**:
       - Show low-stock alerts and recommendations on expected demand.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Backend**: Use Google AutoML or TensorFlow Lite to create a predictive model.
     - **Data Requirements**: Sales history, seasonal data, and current inventory levels.

### **MongoDB Database Schema for Phase 4**

1. **User Data Collection** (For Recommendations)
   - Store user behavior and interactions for recommendation analysis.

     ```javascript
     // userInteractions collection
     {
       _id: ObjectId,
       userId: ObjectId,
       productId: ObjectId,
       interactionType: String, // e.g., "view", "purchase"
       timestamp: Date
     }
     ```

2. **Inventory Data for Prediction**
   - Data to help predict inventory requirements.

     ```javascript
     // inventory collection
     {
       _id: ObjectId,
       productId: ObjectId,
       stockLevel: Number,
       lastRestocked: Date,
       predictedDemand: Number, // Generated by AI model
       restockAlert: Boolean
     }
     ```

   - **Step 3**: Display personalized product suggestions on the website.

2. **Chatbot Integration**:
   - **Step 1**: User interacts with the chatbot on the website.
   - **Step 2**: The chatbot uses a trained NLP model to respond.
   - **Step 3**: Chatbot assists with product info, policies, and support.

3. **Predictive Inventory Management**:
   - **Step 1**: Collect and store past sales data.
   - **Step 2**: Predict demand and stock needs using AI.
   - **Step 3**: Alert the shop owner on the admin dashboard for low-stock products.
